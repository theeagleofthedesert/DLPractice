**This is a practice project using Kaggle competition:**
_https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dhu-ailab-image-classification_

1. __Build the dataset of size 64x64__: make sure you complete this step before training
```cmd
python build_dataset.py --data_dir data\\RawData --output_dir data\\64x64

2. __Your first experiment__ We created a `base_model` directory for you under the `experiments` directory. It contains a file `params.json` which sets the hyperparameters for the experiment. It looks like
```json
{
    "learning_rate": 1e-3,
    "batch_size": 32,
    "num_epochs": 10,
    ...
}
```
For every new experiment, you will need to create a new directory under `experiments` with a similar `params.json` file.

3. __Train__ your experiment. Simply run
```
python train.py --data_dir data\\64x64 --model_dir experiments\\base_model  
```
It will instantiate a model and train it on the training set following the hyperparameters specified in `params.json`. It will also evaluate some metrics on the validation set.

4. __Your first hyperparameters search__ We created a new directory `learning_rate` in `experiments` for you. Now, run
```
python search_hyperparams.py --data_dir data\\64x64 --parent_dir experiments\\learning_rate
```
It will train and evaluate a model with different values of learning rate defined in `search_hyperparams.py` and create a new directory for each experiment under `experiments/learning_rate/`.

5. __Display the results__ of the hyperparameters search in a nice format
```
python synthesize_results.py --parent_dir experiments\\learning_rate
```

6. __Evaluation on the test set__ Once you've run many experiments and selected your best model and hyperparameters based on the performance on the validation set, you can finally evaluate the performance of your model on the test set. Run
```
python evaluate.py --data_dir data\\64x64 --model_dir experiments\\base_model --output True --raw_data_dir data\\RawData
```
